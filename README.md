#### rosterDifferences.py
Finds the differences in 2 rosters. Written to make my life easier during AFX
- How to use:
  - download rosterDifferences.py

  - have a copy of your **old** roster
  - run `python rosterDifferences.py <path to old roster file> <path new roster file>`
    - Ex: `python rosterDifferences.py ~/Documents/oldAssembleRoster.json ~/Downloads/newAssembleRoster.json`
  - press enter :') 


#### takeShots.py
Randomizes time intervals for when to take a shot. This was interesting during small socials... Don't @ me :) 

#### nameSorter.py
Given an array of Strings, sorts the array according to their total alphabet value. IE {A: 1, B: 2...}, ["abc"] == 6.
I dont remember what the purpose of this was...
